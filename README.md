# Algorithms and solutions for coding interview questions

After earning my Msc in Mathematics, I started working on practical things. 
So I never had time to try solving these algorithms questions that you are expected to know on 
coding interviews in software companies.
I finally wanted to set aside some time to recall how to think about simple algorithms.
I was thinking If I should solve this problems in python or javascript because I am fluent in both of them.
But choose python.


### Methodology
Every solution is another function in `Solution` class.
When starting to solve problem, goal is to solve it fast and dirty at first iteration and this will
be functions that starts with `simple_` keyword.
After the solution is correct, I should iterate more to find better or different implementation. This will force me 
to think more about problem and to obtain better understanding.
