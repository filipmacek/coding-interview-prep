# Algorithms and solutions for coding interview questions

After I got my Msc in Mathematics, I started working on practical things.
So I never had a time to look up and try to solve this algorithms questions 
that you are expected to know on coding interviews in software companies.
I finally wanted to set aside some time to recall how to think about simple algorithms.
